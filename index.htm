					<p>And if you're a part of my family, I will love you violently. If you infiltrate and try to hurt my family, I will murder you violently.</p>
					<p>Yeah. I did. Because he's nothing shy of that. And it is his job to go out there and embarrass people. Embarrass them. Not just beat them, but embarrass them in the process.</p>
					<p>I'm cured. I'm done. 'Well, we all have to sit in here and touch ourselves and frown.' Well, you don't look like you're having a lot of fun.</p>

It's just that if I bring up these ... these turds ... these little losers ... there's no reason to then bring them back into the fold, because I have real fame, and they have nothing.</p>
			<p>But ... whatever. I agreed to do it. There's just one deal point that Jim Robinson - a wonderful man at Morgan Creek, a great company - need to work out is they want me in it. If they do, it's a smash. If they don't, it's a turd that opens on a tugboat.</p>
